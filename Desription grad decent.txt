Boston DataSet

Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.
You are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. As studied in lecture, your task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.
Your task is to:
1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results. 

Gradient Descent - Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset

Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011),
when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
